## **How to Stay Motivated While Learning a New Language**

Learning anything can be challenging, and language learning is no exception to this. Not only is there a lot to learn, but it can take a long time. That's why, when it comes to learning a new language, you need the motivation to do it, and if you are not motivated, you will end up finding the journey a lot harder than you would have liked. Due to this, in this article, we're going to talk about how to stay motivated during this amazing journey you are about to embark on.

## **1. Set Clear Goals**

When you start off on your learning journey, one of the first things you should do is set some goals. While at first you may not see the value in this, there are a few reasons why this is important. Not only will this help keep you motivated, as you try to meet or even surpass your goals, but you'll also help yourself see what exactly you're wanting to learn. It could be as simple as wanting to learn how to order food at a restaurant in Spanish, to being able to maintain a conversation in French with a native. Either way, this step will help you realise why exactly, you want to learn a language.

## **2. Find a "Study Buddy"**

One of the best ways to stay motivated while learning a language is to find yourself a "study buddy"! A what? A study buddy is someone, anyone, who you can learn and improve with. This could be a family member, a friend, a colleague, or even a random stranger on the internet. (A great place to find someone online would be at [LangX](https://langx.io/)). Not only will this person help you learn, but, they'll help support you and keep you motivated in your journey. (As will you, to them!)

## **3. Make Learning Fun with Apps and Games**

One of the easiest ways to keep even the most distractable person focused and motivated on something is to make sure they're having fun while they do it. That's why, when learning your target language you should make it fun. This could involve making a game of memory for yourself using vocabulary that you want to memorize, or you could use some of the very popular language learning apps out there like [Duolingo](https://duolingo.com/) for example. Duolingo provides a gamified way to learn languages, that many people find helps keep them motivated to learn regularly.

## **4. Celebrate Small Wins**

While you're doing this, remember, you are doing something that is hard. Be proud of each small accomplishment. Don't hesitate to reward yourself for each small win! Did you just successfully ask for the time in your target language? Or did you just ask for directions with it? No matter how big or small the accomplishment, enjoy it, soak it in, buy yourself a treat, take a break, have a snack, and know that soon, if you keep this up, you'll get to experience this feeling again!

## **5. Immerse Yourself**

You are learning an entirely new language, so why shouldn't you enjoy the benefits that come with it? If you've been learning German, read a book in german. You've been learning Polish? Watch a movie in Polish! Whatever language you've been learning, find a way to apply your new found knowledge, and look forward to the next time you get to read another chapter, or watch another movie!

## **6. Stay Consistent**

While learning, make a routine. Whether it be learn for ten minutes or half an hour. Whether it be in the morning or at night. If you develop a routine with language learning incorporated into it, you'll find yourself instinctively learning more and more each day. You'll find yourself looking forward to the next day, when you'll get to learn some more. When it comes to learning a language, consistency is key!

## **7. Remember Why You Started**

Why did you want to learn a language? Was it for a job you wanted? Was it for a secret language among friends? Was it just for something to do? Whatever your reasoning, think back to it. This was what prompted you to start out on this journey. This, is your ultimate motivation. If you ever find yourself getting demotivated, think back to why you started, and remember, with each day, you are one day closer to achieving your goal!

## **Conclusion**

Learning a new language is a monumentous task, and to be able to stick with it, requires motivation and determination. If you ever find yourself lacking either of these, think of this article, or even better, come back to read it, and remember. You can do it!
