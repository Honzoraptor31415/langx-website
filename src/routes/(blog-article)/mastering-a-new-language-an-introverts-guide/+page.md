## Mastering a New Language - An Introvert's Guide

Learning a language as an introvert can be challenging, mainly due to the fact that one of the best methods for language acquisition is to interact with natives and those who are fluent in the language. However, due to that not being an option for some, in this article, we will be talking about how you can learn a language, without even leaving the house.

## Online Language Courses and Apps

When it comes to learning a language, online language courses and apps nowadays are really popular, and for good reason. Not only do they help you learn a language in a structured and organized way, however they also aid in tracking progress, as well as it being self paced and available to do in a comfortable environment of your choice! (Like your home for example.) Some good examples of online courses and apps for language acquisition are the following:

- [Duolingo](https://duolingo.com/)
- [Babbel](https://babbel.com/)
- [Rosetta Stone](https://rosettastone.com/)

These are some of the more popular language courses and apps, however, if these aren't what you're looking for, I can assure you that you'll be able to find something that suits your learning style.

## Language Learning Software

Slightly different from the language apps and courses above, language learning software helps you retain knowledge, and can be a good activity to do after spending fifteen minutes on one of the above. Some popular options in this category would be:

- [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
- [Memrise](https://memrise.com/)

These websites help by utilizing spaced repetition for vocabulary building. This can help due to it focusing on solo study and memorization techniques, further helping boost your knowledge of your target language.

## Language Exchange Apps

When it comes to languages, interacting with natives or people who speak the language fluently is a really big part of the learning process, however, there are alternatives. Mainly, language exchange apps. These are apps that allow you to communicate with other speakers of the language you are trying to learn, thus giving you that interaction. A couple of options for this is:

- [LangX](https://langx.io/)
- [HelloTalk](https://hellotalk.com/)

In this section, I'll talk mainly about [LangX](https://langx.io/) due to me being more familiar with it, however both are great examples of language exchange apps. With [LangX](https://langx.io/), you are able to send messages to other users, as well as voice messages. This gives you the opportunity to practice both your verbal and writing skills in your target language. The best thing is, of course, the ability to hide behind a profile, meaning no judgement. Due to these reasons, language exchange apps are truly the way to go.

## Watching Movies and TV Shows

What better way to learn a language than to do it while having fun? There isn't one! Watching movies and TV shows in the language you're learning can be a great way to learn the language. In addition, it will help teach you the way people speak, and common cultural expressions, further immersing you in the language. If you don't understand everything you hear, that's okay! That will come with time, and in the meantime, feel free to turn on the subtitles and follow along that way.

## Reading Books and Articles

Like watching movies and tv shows, this can help grow your vocabulary, while still enjoying yourself. You'll be able to learn new words, travel to faraway worlds, and go on an adventure or two, all without needing to leave the house. Is there a better way to spend the evening? I think not.

## Listening to Music, Podcasts, and Audiobooks

Listening to audio in the language you're learning is a great technique for language acquisition. Not only will you be able to learn without needing to interact with other people, but you will be able to listen whenever you want. It could be at home, on the way to work, in the bathroom. No matter where, you can learn and enjoy!

## Writing Practice

The above have showed you ways to help expand your vocabulary, and interact with others without the awkwardness, however, when it comes to language, you need to be able to write it as well. A great way to solve this is to write. Write a book, write about your learning experience, write about your day, whatever you write about, do it in the language you're learning. Not only will you be able to learn new words while doing so, but you'll get to see how much progress you're actually making!

## Conclusion

Learning a language can be hard, even without being an introvert, however, with this set of handy tips and tricks, you'll find yourself keeping up with the rest of the language learners out there. Remember, you've got this! Good luck!
